 Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a 1991 American science fiction action film produced and directed by James Cameron, who co-wrote the script with William Wisher. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong, and Joe Morton. It is the sequel to the 1984 film The Terminator, and the second installment in the Terminator franchise. It follows Sarah Connor and her ten-year-old son John as they are pursued by a new, more advanced Terminator: the liquid metal, shape shifting T-1000, sent back in time to kill John and prevent him from becoming the leader of the human resistance. A second, less-advanced Terminator is also sent by the Resistance to protect John.
Talks of a follow-up to The Terminator arose following its release, but its development was stalled due to technical limitations of the vital computer-generated imagery, and legal issues with original producer Hemdale Film Corporation, who controlled half of the franchise rights. In 1990, Carolco Pictures acquired the rights from Hemdale and production immediately began, with Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and Cameron returning. Principal photography began in October 1990 and lasted until March 1991. Its visual effects saw breakthroughs in computer-generated imagery, including the first use of natural human motion for a computer-generated character and the first partially computer-generated main character. At the time of its release, with a budget of $94â€“102 million, Terminator 2: Judgment Day was the most expensive film ever made!
